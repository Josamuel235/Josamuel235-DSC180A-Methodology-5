1. Name: Joseph Samuel, Email: Josamuel@ucsd.edu
2. Section Number: B05, Section Name: Diffusion Process as a Generative Model, Mentor: Arya Mazumdar
3. Prompts:
  - **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
    - Answer: The most interesting topic is the fact that different distributions impact the generative ability of the model
  - **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project**
    - Answer: I want to investigate utilizing autoencoder for the diffusion process and how the autoencoders affect the denoising ability
  - **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
    - Answer: One Change I would have made is instead of first reading the paper to udnerstand the model I would have started by looking at the code to get an idea of what the model does
  - **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
    - Answer: I want to understand how stacking diffusion models affects the genertative ability of diffusion models
